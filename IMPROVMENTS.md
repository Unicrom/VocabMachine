Add three modes to the study system:
1. Learning: keeps track of missed words and accuracy for each word. Makes missed words more likely to reappear
2. Normal: shows a random word each time.
3. Test: each word only appears one time until all words are completed. Keep track of questions attempted and questions answered correctly. Then the user is given an overall accuracy once the test is completed.

Improvments for the study page:
Make the user experience a lot more simple. At the top have a side scrolling flexbox of all the lists. Each list should be toggable. Remove the functinoality of selecting certain words from each list

For the mode, have a set of tabs for each overall mode (spelling, defintion, synoym, antynoym)
have a small settings icon on the bottom right which brings up a menu with the following options:
- Match \_\_\_ to Word / Match word to \_\_\_ (This is an option that toggles between the two states and it controls whether the program shows the user the answer or the word.)
- Mode dropdown with three modes. (How the user selects their mode, have Normal as default)
